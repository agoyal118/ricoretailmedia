## Overview

Over the past four years, DUDE Wipes has partnered with us to drive significant growth through a comprehensive omni channel strategy. We managed advertising and digital strategies across all major retailers, ensuring a strong online presence and creating targeted ad campaigns that maximized visibility and engagement.

We meticulously put together budgets and forecasts for each retailer, allowing us to allocate resources effectively. By predicting trends and adjusting budgets, we optimized spend efficiency and maximized return on investment.

We oversaw the overall digital strategy, including social media management and search engine optimization. Our holistic approach ensured that all digital channels worked together to drive brand awareness and sales.

To complement our digital strategies, we managed in-store activations such as sampling and experiential marketing. These efforts boosted in-store visibility and drove trial and repeat purchases. As a result, DUDE Wipes' budgets and sales have grown over 5x during our partnership, demonstrating the success of our omni channel strategy.
