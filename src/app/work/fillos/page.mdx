## Overview

FILLOs has achieved a +60% increase in sales over the past four months through strategic improvements in our operations and marketing. Our efforts included meticulous management of our Amazon and Walmart platforms to ensure optimal product visibility and customer engagement.

A key initiative was rebuilding our advertising strategy to be acquisition-focused and top-notch. By leveraging data-driven insights and advanced targeting, we created highly effective ad campaigns that attracted a larger audience and boosted conversions.

We also tackled inventory issues by implementing measures to reduce out-of-stock situations. Streamlining our supply chain and inventory management ensured our products were consistently available, improving customer satisfaction and preventing revenue losses.

Our re-merchandizing efforts, including optimizing images, titles, and bullet points, enhanced the shopping experience. We overhauled our variation strategy and implemented in-store sampling programs to drive in-store velocity and increase brand awareness. These combined efforts significantly contributed to FILLO’s impressive growth and solidified our market position.
